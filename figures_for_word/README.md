# Figures for Heat-Health Research Paper

## Instructions for Word Document

These 5 figures should be inserted into the Word document at the locations marked as figure placeholders in the HTML version. Each figure has a corresponding caption in the main text.

## Figure Descriptions

### Figure 1: Figure1_ModelPerformance.png
**Location in paper:** Section 3.2 (Model Performance and Predictability)
**Caption:** Model performance metrics for predicting health outcomes. Panel A shows R² values for different machine learning algorithms across health domains. Panel B displays sample sizes for each outcome category. XGBoost consistently achieved the highest predictive accuracy, particularly for glucose metabolism and blood pressure outcomes.

### Figure 2: Figure2_TemporalPatterns_Fixed.png
**Location in paper:** Section 3.3 (Temporal Dynamics of Heat-Health Relationships)
**Caption:** Temporal dynamics of heat-health relationships. Panel A shows model performance (R²) across different lag windows for glucose metabolism. Panel B displays temperature threshold effects on health outcomes. Panel C illustrates seasonal vulnerability patterns throughout the year. The 21-day lag window consistently provided optimal predictive performance.

### Figure 3: Figure3_SHAPImportance_Fixed.png
**Location in paper:** Section 3.4 (Feature Importance and Mechanistic Insights)
**Caption:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature importance analysis. Panel A shows mean absolute SHAP values for different predictor categories across health outcomes. Panel B displays feature interaction effects between environmental and socioeconomic variables. Panel C illustrates individual feature contributions for a representative high-vulnerability participant. Housing quality and income consistently emerge as the most influential predictors.

### Figure 4: Figure4_VulnerabilityDistribution.png
**Location in paper:** Section 3.5 (Socioeconomic Amplification of Vulnerability)
**Caption:** Distribution of heat vulnerability across the study population. Panel A shows the distribution of individual vulnerability scores. Panel B displays heat sensitivity by socioeconomic quartile for different health outcomes. Panel C illustrates geographic clustering of vulnerability in Johannesburg. The extreme heterogeneity demonstrates the critical role of socioeconomic factors in determining heat-health impacts.

### Figure 5: Figure5_GenderDifferences_Fixed.png
**Location in paper:** Section 3.6 (Gender-Specific Responses)
**Caption:** Gender-specific responses to heat exposure. Panel A shows heat sensitivity coefficients for men and women across different health outcomes. Panel B displays the interaction between gender and socioeconomic status in determining heat vulnerability. Panel C illustrates age-stratified gender differences in heat responses. Women consistently demonstrate higher metabolic and inflammatory sensitivity to heat exposure.
